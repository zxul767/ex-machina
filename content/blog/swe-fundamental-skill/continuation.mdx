## Learning Efficiently

Searching for little pieces of information to get a task done or gain some cursory understanding about a topic is a great skill, but what happens when we need to learn a larger set of related topics (e.g., we want to learn what is all the fuss about machine learning)?

Well, in the extreme, we could just apply what I’ve described above and search bits and pieces of information that we’ll surely run into as we start exploring a topic. However, unless you prefer discovering things in an unstructured, exploratory manner by yourself, perhaps taking a course, reading a book, or even taking a specialization (e.g., a [nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) in Udacity), could be a better path to get a more structured introduction to a complex topic.

If you choose that route, you’re likely to have to commit a considerable amount of hours to reading materials, watching lectures, doing exercises, etc., and the question of how to most effectively learn becomes very relevant.

### No Single Source of Truth

There is no universal recipe for anyone to learn more efficiently. This is simply because we are very diverse in how we process information (although more recent [research](https://nesslabs.com/learning-how-to-learn) has contested the long-held idea that people fall into one of various learning styles.)

Personally, something that has worked very well for me is to always explore various resources and types of media (books, blog posts, videos, podcasts, etc.), trying to see a topic from various angles, looking for common points, contradictions, and nuanced takes.

The purpose of my learning is also crucial to choose the strategy I use. If I’m just trying to get familiar with something out of curiosity, I may use a less active approach than what I described in the previous section, and instead opt to just watch a few short videos just to “dip my toes in the water.” On the other hand, if I’m trying to understand something more deeply, I will definitely use a more active approach, combining material from various sources.

For complex topics (e.g., [how neural networks learn](https://zxul767.dev/backpropagation))[^neural-nets], even the best explanations sometimes leave gaps that we can only cover by watching, reading, experimenting, etc., with multiple perspectives by various authors. It’s like that old story of [the blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant): the only way to get a strong grasp of something is if we integrate multiple perspectives.

### Side Projects

This bears repeating: the most significant learning in software development comes with practice.

The best possible scenario is when I have a chance to practice at work what I’ve just recently learned. However, this is not always the case. And even when it is, the specific circumstances surrounding my current project might make it infeasible to experiment as freely as I might want to. If that’s the case, the solution is simple: I create my own side projects to experiment with.

These side projects might range from simple toy projects to test my knowledge and understanding of something, to perhaps something more ambitious where I can put into practice many more things, and also feel more motivated to push things through to completion.

In today’s computing world, many projects that just a decade ago were infeasible or very hard to do with a modest budget, have become feasible thanks to cloud computing offerings from various vendors, going from virtual machines, to managed databases, to CI/CD pipelines, all the way to free GPU access (e.g., see [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb) or [Paperspace](https://gradient.paperspace.com/notebooks)) to train machine learning models.

### Learning How To Learn

Even though we spend almost all of our careers learning new things, we don’t often stop to think whether we can significantly improve how we learn. We go through life perhaps thinking that the ability to learn is innate in each person and somewhat fixed, so we don’t even bother to try and improve it. For instance, it’s “common knowledge” that unless we learned a foreign language as kids, we will have a much harder time learning one as adults. However, there’s reason to believe this is not really always the case.

If you're interested in this topic, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) has a course entitled [“Learning How To Learn”](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) where you can learn about techniques to boost your learning skills, all based on principles of how the brain works.

As I mentioned earlier, while I don’t think there’s a universal recipe for learning due to our individuality, it is nonetheless undeniable that all humans share common traits when it comes to how our brains work, so it is worth trying some of the techniques presented in that course.

Two techniques I have found particularly useful to retain information long-term are _Priming_, _Thinking Deeply_ and _Summarizing_.

#### Priming

Simply put, priming is “warming up” your brain to the context of the new skill or topic you’re trying to learn. For example, it has been observed that students who are about to learn a new language and are exposed early on to auditory input (e.g., radio programs in the new language) even when they don’t understand a thing initially, are more likely to learn faster once a formal course begins.

This may seem a bit like magic, but it’s really just our brain at work--in particular our neocortex--which is constantly looking to make sense of patterns (visual, tactile, auditory, etc.), finding structure which will be mapped to existing knowledge later on.

In the context of programming, priming can take many forms. If I’m about to take a course on functional programming, listening to a podcast episode on it during my daily commute, reading a [comic strip](https://xkcd.com/1312/) on it, skimming over what people are [tweeting](https://twitter.com/search?q=functional%20programming&src=typed_query) about it, etc., are all forms of starting to immerse my brain in the ideas surrounding functional programming. This will prove useful later on, even if at first I find myself not understanding everything I hear or read.

#### Thinking Deeply

Thinking deeply about what we just read or watched in a video is for some reason one of the most neglected aspects of learning. Perhaps that's because it is taken for granted, but when we set out to explicitly do it, the results are often quite surprising.

Whenever I approach a new topic, I try to explicitly think about the things I already know or the things I can imagine or conjecture about it. For example, if I'm about to take a course on how compilers work, I begin by thinking about how I would build a compiler myself if I had no other recourse but my own existing knowledge and nothing else:

> I imagine that I will need a way to open the file with the source code, read the program and turn it into some intermediate representation, which I can then use to generate low-level machine code.

> I also imagine that I may need some way to detect syntax errors and keep information about the locations of the errors in the original file so that I can show useful error messages to the user.

I may not be able to actually build a compiler by just thinking about it, but this "simple" act puts my mind in a more receptive state. It will also deepen my understanding as I take the course and realize that some of my assumptions and conjectured solutions were either wrong, correct or generally on the right track.

"No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking."
— Voltaire

#### Summarizing

Oftentimes a topic can be difficult because of all the intricate details it entails. However, if I manage to get a hold of the fundamental ideas, I can often forget about the details and simply look them up when needed. This is what summarizing is all about: identifying key ideas and their relationships, and suppressing unnecessary detail.

> This is what summarizing is all about: identifying key ideas and their relationships, and suppressing unnecessary detail.

This is one of my favorite techniques when I'm trying to learn deeply a topic, as I know it guarantees long-term retention and the ability to see connections to other ideas and topics. It is obviously more time-consuming, but its long-term benefits make it completely worth it.
